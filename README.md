**UPD 2023**: I've decided to make this repo public again as a small tribute to my childhood hobby of tinkering with *nix systems. Although Reddit posts are no longer active, you can still find screenshots and additional information in the subfolders. Who knows, maybe you'll find something useful here, stranger? Happy exploring!
